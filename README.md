# CNN_Based_Leaf_Disease_Detection_DL_Model
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model for detecting diseases in plant leaves. The model is trained to classify images of plant leaves into different disease categories using deep learning techniques. It utilizes TensorFlow and Keras libraries for building and training the CNN model.  

Features
Utilizes CNN architecture for accurate disease classification.
Preprocessing techniques such as image augmentation for enhancing model performance.
Integration of TensorFlow and Keras for seamless model development and training.
Capable of detecting various diseases in plant leaves with high accuracy.
Provides a user-friendly interface for deploying the model for real-world applications.
Usage
Training the Model: Train the model using the provided dataset by running the training script. Adjust hyperparameters as needed for optimal performance.

Prediction: Once trained, use the trained model to predict diseases in plant leaves. Sample prediction scripts are provided for reference.

Integration: Integrate the model into your application or system for automated disease detection in plant leaves.

Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset consisting of images of plant leaves affected by various diseases, including apple scab, black rot, cedar apple rust, maize leaf spot, common rust, black rot in grapes, late blight in potatoes, bacterial spot in tomatoes, early blight in tomatoes, and leaf mold in tomatoes. The dataset is organized into respective directories for each disease category.

Dependencies
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV (for image processing)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
PySerial (for serial communication, if applicable)
