# CNN_Based_Leaf_Disease_Detection_DL_Model
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model for detecting diseases in plant leaves. The model is trained to classify images of plant leaves into different disease categories using deep learning techniques. It utilizes TensorFlow and Keras libraries for building and training the CNN model.  Features
